== Name

ttyplot â€“ realtime terminal plotting utility

== Synopsis

*ttyplot* [-2] [-k] [-r] [-b] [-c char] [-e char] [-E char] [-s scale] [-S scale] [-m max] [-M min] [-t title] [-u unit] [-C 'col1 col2 ...']

== Description

ttyplot takes data from standard input, most commonly some tool like
ping(1), snmpget(1), netstat(8), ifconfig(8), sar(1), vmstat(8), etc., and
plots in text mode on a terminal in real time.

Supports rate calculation for counters, one or two graphs on a single
display using reverse video for second line, or any number of graphs with
input as key/value pairs.

== Options

*-2*::
  read two values and draw two plots

*-k*::
  key/value mode

*-r*::
  rate of a counter (divide value by measured sample interval)

*-b*::
  draw bar charts

*-c*::
  character(s) for the graph, not used with key/value mode

*-e*::
  character to use for error line when value exceeds hardmax, default: 'e'

*-E*::
  character to use for error symbol displayed when value is less than hardmin, default: 'v'

*-s*::
  initial positive scale of the plot (can go above if data input has larger value)

*-S*::
  initial negative scale of the plot

*-m*::
  maximum value, if exceeded draws error line (see -e), upper-limit of plot scale is fixed

*-M*::
  minimum value, if entered less than this, draws error symbol (see -E), lower-limit of the plot scale is fixed

*-t*::
  title of the plot

*-u*::
  unit displayed beside vertical bar

*-C*::
  set list of colors:
  * black,blk,bk
  * red,rd
  * green,grn,gr
  * yellow,yel,yl
  * blue,blu,bl
  * magenta,mag,mg
  * cyan,cya,cy,cn
  * white,wht,wh

== Bugs

In unix by default stdio is buffered.
This can be disabled in various ways like
http://www.perkin.org.uk/posts/how-to-fix-stdio-buffering.html
or https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Exec#Output_buffering

ttyplot quits and erases the screen when there is no more data.
This is by design and can be worked around by adding sleep(1) or read(1), for example:

  { echo 1 2 3; sleep 1000; } | ttyplot

When running interactively and non-numeric data is entered (e.g. some key)
ttyplot hangs.  Press `Ctrl^j` to reset.
